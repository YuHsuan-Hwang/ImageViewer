## Current Features
* zooming: rebin the image to certain resolution when zooming

## Issues
* Too slow for reading large images
* The response time shown in console is not correct when sending too many messages in a short time

## Future Work
* Optimize the algorithm of rebinning
* Apply protobuf to calculate the exact response time
* Send arrays and display image by frontend

## Current Features
* display cube data
* focus zooming and panning: rebin the image to screen resolution
* show image histogram, adjust color scale
* show x,y,z profile of the cursor position
* change image channel
* show histogram of the whole cube data

## Issues
* x axis coordinate does not show after reversed x axis
